= Asynchronous processing

The term asynchronous processing refers to any strategy in which the processing of some tasks does *[not block]* the processing of other tasks.

Asynchronous processing may be implemented within a *link:./monolith.adoc[monolith]* using *link:./concurrency.adoc[concurrency]* and *link:./parallelism.adoc[parallelism]* (ie. *link:./asynchronous-programming[asynchronous programming]*), or by passing *link:./asynchronous-communication.adoc[asynchronous messages]* between programs running on multiple systems.

Asynchronous processing is the foundation of *link:./reactive-programming.adoc[reactive programming]* and *link:./message-driven-architecture.adoc[message-driven architecture]*, and is widely used in *link:./distributed-system.adoc[distributed software]* to improve performance and scalability.
