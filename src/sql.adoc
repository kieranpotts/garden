= Structured Query Language (SQL)

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating *[relational databases]*, allowing users to perform tasks such as querying data, defining database structure, and modifying data records.

SQL is used for two things:

* To define the structure of a database â€” its elements, attributes, and constraints.
* To insert, update, delete, and query data.
