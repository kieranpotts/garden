= The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)

https://www.opengroup.org/togaf

TOGAF is a framework for the design, planning, implementation, and governing of enterprise
information technology architecture.

TOGAF is made up of a number of standards, which are maintained by The Open Group – which also
maintains the related *link:./archimate.adoc[ArchiMate]* standard – and at the centre of which
is the *Architecture Development Method (ADM), which provides a process life cycle for creating
and managing architectures within an enterprise.

A https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap30.html[content metamodel] defines
a formal structure for architecture artifacts. It defines the inputs, outputs, and steps used
in the ADM process.
