= Scalability

Scalability is a *quality attribute* of an IT system. It describes a requirement for a system to
handle increased workloads, such as more data, more users, or more operations and transactions.

== Scalability techniques

In broad terms, there are two main ways to scale a system:

*link:./horizontal-scaling.adoc[Horizontal scaling]* (aka. *scaling out*) means adding more nodes
to a system, such as adding more servers to a server farm.

And *link:./vertical-scaling.adoc[vertical scaling]* (aka. *scaling up*) means increasing the
capacity of individual nodes, such as using a more powerful server.

The following strategies are also relevant:
