= Event-based systems

*Event-based* systems are distinct from *link:./event-driven-architecture.adoc[event-driven]* systems.

In event-driven systems, the events are *business events*, such as "order placed" or "order shipped". These events are meaningful in the context of the business *[domain]*.

In event-based systems, the events are *technical events*, such as a button being clicked or a mouse cursor moving. These events are meaningful in the context of the system's user interface.

GUIs are event-based systems. So too are many *[public cloud computing]* systems. For example, uploading a file to a *[cloud storage]* service will trigger a technical event to represent the file being created in the storage system.
