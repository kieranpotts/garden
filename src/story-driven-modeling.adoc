= Story-driven modeling

Story-driven modeling is an [object-oriented] [modeling] technique. Other forms of object-oriented modeling tend to focus on classes, so describing the structure of the systems (it's building blocks and internal interactions). Story-driven modeling, on the other hand, focuses on the behavior of the system, and how it interacts with the outside world.
