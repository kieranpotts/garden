= Telemetry

Telemetry is the automatic in situ recording of data from a system, and its transmission to a receiving station from where the data can be *link:./monitoring.adoc[monitored]* and analyzed (eg. using *link:./observability.adoc[observability]* tools).

Telemetry data can be gathered from different sources, to monitor and observe different aspects of a system, and depending on the observability strategy. See the *link:./monitoring.adoc[monitoring]* and *link:./observability.adoc[observability]* sections for examples.
