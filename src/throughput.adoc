= Throughput (aka. bandwidth)

// TODO: https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-throughput-and-latency/

Throughput is a measure of the amount of work done, or the amount of data processed, in a given amount of time. It is also known as *bandwidth*. and is typically expressed in terms of *requests per second (RPS)* or *transactions per second (TPS)*.

As a *link:./quality-attributes.adoc[quality attribute]* of *link:./distributed-system.adoc[distributed software]*, trade-offs may be made with *link:./latency.adoc[latency]*. For example, to increase throughput you might *[batch]* requests together, process data in *[parallel]*, or *[spread load]* across multiple servers. But these strategies can have the effect of increasing the time individual requests spend waiting in queues, thereby increasing latency.
