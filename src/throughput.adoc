= Throughput

Throughput is a measure of the amount of work done, or the amount of data processed, in a given
amount of time.

It is typically expressed in terms of *requests per second (RPS)* or *transactions per second (TPS)*.

As a *link:./quality-attributes.adoc[quality attribute]*, throughput is often paired with
*link:./latency.adoc[latency]*, which refers to the time it takes for an operation to complete.
