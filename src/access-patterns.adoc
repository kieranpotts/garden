= Access patterns

A key consideration in *link:./system-design.adoc[system design]* is the access patterns of the data.

Access patterns describe how data is read and written, and how it is queried. Systems may be
*read-heavy* or *write-heavy*, or have a balanced mix of reads and writes. The access patterns
of a system are influenced by its *[domain]* and *link:./requirements.adoc[requirements]* such as
*link:./scalability.adoc[scalability]*, *link:./availability.adoc[availability]*, and
*link:./consistency.adoc[consistency]*.

Access patterns can have a significant influence on the *link:./architecture-and-design.adoc[design]*,
of a system, but the patterns may not be fully understood until the system is in production.
Therefore, optimizing the system design for its access patterns is a challenging *[constraint]*
and may require *[iterative]* design improvements.
