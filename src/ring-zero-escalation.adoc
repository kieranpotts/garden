= Ring zero escalation

Ring zero escalation refers to a type of privilege escalation attack where an attacker gains access to the highest privilege level in a computer system, known as ring 0, which is the level at which the operating system kernel operates.

Escalating to ring zero allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, potentially taking full control of the system.
