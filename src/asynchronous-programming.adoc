= Asynchronous programming

*Asynchronous programming* is when a computer program manages two or more tasks simultaneously, but those tasks or events do not necessarily execute at exactly the same time, ie. they are not synchronous.

*link:./concurrency.adoc[Concurrency]* and *link:./parallelism.adoc[parallelism]* are different solutions to achieving asynchronous operations. Sometimes, the operations are not truly asynchronous at all, but are really _deferred_ operations; they are handled by the main thread but only after the program has returned its response to the user or client.

In JavaScript, for example, `async` operations are concurrent ones that are implemented using promise-based APIs. They are ideal for waiting on input or responses from external systems or users, without blocking other processing on the main thread in the meantime.

Asynchronous programming specifically refers to any design pattern in which some tasks are somehow separated from the main thread of execution of a computer program, such that the asynchronous tasks are *non-blocking* of the main thread, but are still processed by the same *[node]*.

*link:./asynchronous-communication.adoc[Asynchronous communication]* is a related concept, but refers specifically to any method of exchanging messages _between_ *[nodes]*, in which the sending, receiving, and processing of each message is not dependent upon the sending, receipt, or processing of other messages. For example, messages may be sent without waiting for a response or even acknowledgement, and receivers may process messages after they have been received, and perhaps in any order. Email is the classic example of asynchronous communication.

*link:./asynchronous-processing.adoc[Asynchronous processing]* of data may be implemented through either asynchronous execution within a computer program, or asynchronous message passing between programs running on multiple systems.
