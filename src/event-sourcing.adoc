= Event sourcing

Event sourcing is an *[architectural pattern*] in which all changes to the state of entities are
logged as a series of events, in such a way that we can query these events and reconstruct past
application states.

An event sourcing architecture will be necessary for organizations that need to preserve an
accurate history or data managed by their systems, for example for the purpose of fraud detection.
