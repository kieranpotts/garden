= Strangler fig pattern

The strangler fig pattern is an *[architectural pattern]* used in programming to manage risk when
modernizing or rewriting large, monolithic systems. It involves wrapping old code and redirecting
it to newer code, or logging its use.

The name comes from the strangler fig plant, which grows on trees and eventually kills them.
