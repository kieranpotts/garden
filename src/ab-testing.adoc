= A/B testing

*A/B testing* is a method of comparing two versions of a unit of functionality to determine which one *performs* better, based on predefined *metrics*.

A/B testing is typically used for evaluate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and user experience (UX) design, such as a web interface. However, the strategy can be used to evaluate the relative merits of different implementations of all sorts of software features, including algorithms and machine learning models.

The implementation of A/B testing strategies may be supported by *[feature flag]* systems.
