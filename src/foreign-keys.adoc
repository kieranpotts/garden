= Foreign keys

A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a *[relational database]* table that provides a link
between data in two tables. The foreign key in one table points to the *[primary key]* in another table.

A foreign key is a *constraint* that enforces *referential integrity*, ie. it ensures that the
relationship between two tables remains consistent.
