= Availability zone (AZ)

In *cloud computing*, an availability zone is a distinct location within a cloud provider's infrastructure that is engineered to be isolated from failures in other availability zones.

A *region* is a distinct geographical area, such as a city (eg. London) or area (eg. US East). Each region contains multiple availability zones. An availability zone is analogous to a data centre, which is a single physical facility. Each AZ's data centre is physically separated from the others, such that a failure in one data centre is not likely to cascade into failures in other data centres within the same region.

Availability zones are used to provide *high availability* and *fault tolerance* for applications and services, even when there are data center-level failures â€“ by doing replication across multiple availability zones within each region.
