= Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture

P2P architecture is a decentralized model where each node, or *peer*, in a network has equal
responsibilities and capabilities.

Unlike the *[client-server model]*, there is no central server. Instead, each peer can act as both
a client and a server, sharing resources and data directly with other peers.

P2P networks are known for their *[resilience]* and *[scalability]*, since there is no central
point of failure and the system can scale easily simply by adding new peers to the network.
