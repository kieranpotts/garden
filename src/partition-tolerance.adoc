= Partition tolerance

Partition tolerance is a *link:./quality-attributes.adoc[quality attribute]* of *link:./distributed-system.adoc[distributed software]*. It is a property of *link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[fault-tolerant]* distributed programs that allows them to continue to operate even when network partitions occur.

A network partition is a situation where some nodes in a distributed program can no longer communicate with other nodes. The cause of a network partition could be network failures, software bugs, or other issues.

Network partitions have consequences for data *link:./consistency.adoc[consistency]*, which must be considered in the *link:./system-design.adoc[system design]* and are explained by the *link:./cap-theorem.adoc[CAP theorem]*.
