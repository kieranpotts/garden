= Waterfall (aka. stepwize) model

// The iterative and incremental model for software development is almost as old as the field of software development itself.

// // TODO: This software development methodology is (almost) as old as the discipline of software development itself. True waterfall, or stepwize development, was only done in the very early years when it was incredibly time-consuming to change a piece of code after it was written, because of the time it took to compile then test.

// Today, "waterfall" development is often used as a straw-man to contrast with "agile" development. But the original waterfall model, as described by Winston Royce in 1970, was actually an iterative and incremental model â€“ which is also the foundation of agile ways of working. Royce's waterfall model included feedback loops between each phase of the development process, and he explicitly recommended doing a "first pass" through the entire development process, followed by subsequent passes to refine and improve the product.
