= System design

System design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and
data for a system that satisfies specific requirements.

To meet the needs of an organization, system design requires a systematic
approach to building and engineering systems. A good system design requires
us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data
and how it's stored.

Much of system design is about making trade-offs between high-level goals
and constraints. For example, we might need to prioritize a system being
highly available but less consistent, or we might need to prioritize
consistency over availability.

These sorts of decisions are expensive to change later on. Iterative or
evolutionary design is best avoided at the highest abstractions of a system.
