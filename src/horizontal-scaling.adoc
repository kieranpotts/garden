= Horizontal scaling

Horizontal scaling is a link:./scalability.adoc[scalability] technique that
involves adding more servers to a system, rather than increasing the capacity
of a single server (as in link:./vertical-scaling.adoc[vertical scaling]).

The aim is to increase throughput by distributing the load across multiple
servers, rather than relying on a single server to handle all requests.
