Load balancing is a term that refers to any technique used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers, or other resources. Load balancing is widely used in *[distributed software]* to increase capacity and reliability.

Load balancing is typically implemented using a *link:./load-balancer.adoc[load balancer]*, which is a specific device or software application that performs the load balancing function. But load balancing can also be implemented without a load balancer, using techniques such as *link:./sharding.adoc[sharding]*.
