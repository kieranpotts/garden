= Transactional databases

Also known as *operational databases*, transactional databases are a family of database management systems that are often contrasted with *link:./transactional-databases.adoc[transactional or operational databases]*.

Both transactional and analytical databases may be *link:./nosql-databases.adoc[non-relational]* or *link:./relational-databases.adoc[relational]* â€“ which is another way to classify database management systems.

Transactional databases are used for *Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)*. These are production databases that process *link:./transactions.adoc[transactions]*, eg. adding customer records, checking stock availability, and so on. They tend to be customer-facing DBs.

Examples of relational transactional databases include Amazon RDS, Oracle, IBM DB2, and MySQL. Examples of non-relational transactional databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, and HBase.
