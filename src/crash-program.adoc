= Crash program

A crash program is a project management strategy that sees the rapid deployment of resources to address a critical issue.

The term is not specific to software development but is used in this context. It refers to any intensive or accelerated effort to complete a software project or feature, or a critical bug or security vulnerability.

The goal of a crash program is to deliver results _in the shortest time possible_. Time limits (deadlines) may be applied. Emphasis is on speed over perfection, so regular processes and quality assurance checks may be sacrificed.

Crash programs can be effective short-term tactical solutions to immediate needs and problems. However, they can also lead to long-term technical debt, burnout, and other issues, if not managed carefully.
