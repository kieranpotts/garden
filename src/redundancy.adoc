= Redundancy

In the context of a *link:./distributed-system.adoc[distributed system]*, redundancy refers to the
duplication of critical components or functions of the system. The goal is to increase
*link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[reliability]* and *link:./availability.adoc[availability]*. If one
part of the system fails, another can take over its tasks, minimizing *link:./downtime.adoc[downtime]*
and preventing data loss.

There are different types of redundancy in distributed systems:

* *Data redundancy*: Storing copies of the same data on multiple nodes.

* *Hardware redundancy*: Using additional hardware components, such as servers.

* *Software redundancy*: Deploying multiple instances of the same application.

* *Network redundancy*: Implementing multiple network paths and connections.

Redundancy is an important *link:./quality-attribute.adoc[quality attribute]* in distributed systems
that require high *link:./availability.adoc[availability]*, such as cloud services and data centers.
