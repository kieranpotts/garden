= Entity Component System (ECS)

Entity Component System (ECS) is an *[architectural pattern]* that is widely used in game
development.

ECS follows the *[composition-over-inheritance]* principle. Every object in a game's scene is an
*entity* — enemies, weapons, bullets, buildings, etc. — and each entity is composed from
*components* that determine the entity's behavior, functionality, and other characteristics.

The behavior of an entity can be changed at runtime by adding or removing components. Thus, the
*system* runs continuously and performs global actions on every entity.

ECS architecture is often combined with *[data-oriented design]* techniques.
