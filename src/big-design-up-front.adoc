= Big design up-front

////

Big design up front (BDUF) is a software development approach in which the program's design is to be completed and perfected before that program's implementation is started. It is often associated with the waterfall model of software development.

Synonyms for big design up front (BDUF) are big modeling up front (BMUF) and big requirements up front (BRUF). These are viewed as anti-patterns within agile software development.[1]

BDUF emerged from traditional engineering disciplines (civil, mechanical, electrical) where changes after construction begins are extremely expensive. It was formalized in software through methodologies like:

* Waterfall Model - The classic sequential development approach
* DoD-STD-2167 - U.S. Department of Defense software development standard
* IEEE 12207 - Software lifecycle processes standard
