= DACI framework

The *DACI framework* is a model for the roles involved in decision-making processes within organizations. It is particularly useful for clarifying responsibilities in project management, product development, and other strategic planning activities.

DACI is an acronym for:

* *Driver*: The individual or entity that initiates and leads the decision-making process.
* *Approver*: The person with the authority to grant final approval or veto the decision.
* *Contributors*: Those who provide input and expertise to shape the decision.
* *Informed*: Other stakeholders who just need to be kept informed about the decision.

*RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)* is a similar model, but adds emphasis to who is ultimately accountable for the success (or otherwise) of a decision. The *DAI* model adds a fifth role to the DACI model â€“ a *Delegate*, who is responsible for executing the decision once it has been approved.
