# Ubiquitous language

*link:./domain-driven-design.adoc[Domain-driven design]* gives us the concept of a
ubiquitous language, which is like a consistent *ontology* for software projects. The idea is
that all of a project's stakeholders agree on a common language. Rather than the domain experts
and the technical experts each using their own industry jargon, a shared vocabulary is developed
that all parties understand.

This common language is sourced from the *domain's} real world concepts and terminology, and it is
applied ubiquitously throughout the project, from the system diagrams via the test suites to objects
that make up the source code itself.

The ubiquitous language need be nothing more complicated than a glossary of nouns and verbs that can
be used together to describe all aspects of the domain.
