= Complexity

== Essential versus accidental complexity

All systems are complex because all systems have *essential complexity*. Essential complexity is the complexity that is inherent in the *[problem]* that the system is trying to solve, or the *[domain]* of the software.

For example, a system that is trying to solve the problem of routing packets across a network will have to deal with the inherent complexity of routing algorithms, network topologies, and so on.

You can't eliminate essential complexity in a system, but you can reduce it by reducing the scope of the problem you're trying to solve.

*Accidental complexity* is the type of complexity in software systems that developers have more control over.This is the complexity that comes from the decisions the developers choose to make in the *[system design]*. Different architectural styles, design patterns, programming paradigms, application frameworks, and runtime environments â€“ all of these things make trade-offs between competing *[qualities]*, and therefore bring different types of accidental complexity into a solution.
