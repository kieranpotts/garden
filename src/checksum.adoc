= Checksum

A checksum is a *unique fingerprint* attached to data before it is transmitted over a network.

The checksum is calculated by a checksum algorithm and is used to verify the integrity of the data.
If the data is altered in any way during transmission, the checksum will not match the data. Thus,
when the data is received by a recipient, the fingerprint may be recalculated to ensure it matches
the original one. If the checksum is valid, the recipient node can be confident that the data
hadn't been modified or damaged during transmission over the network.
