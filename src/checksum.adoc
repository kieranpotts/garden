= Checksum

A checksum is a *unique fingerprint* attached to data before it is transmitted over a network. It is used to verify the integrity of the data after its transmission over the network.

The checksum is calculated using a checksum algorithm and is used to verify the integrity of the data. If the data is altered in any way during transmission, the checksum will not match the data. Thus, when the data is received by a recipient, the fingerprint may be recalculated to ensure it matches the original one. If the checksum is valid, the recipient node can be confident that the data hadn't been modified or damaged during transmission over the network.
