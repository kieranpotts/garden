= Availability

Availability is a link:./quality-attributes.adoc[*quality attribute*] that
is a measure of the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible to
its users at all times, even under heavy load and even when parts of the system
fail. It is closely related to link:./scalability.adoc[*scalability*] and
link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[*fault tolerance*].

Availability is typically expressed as a percentage of
link:./uptime.adoc[*uptime*] over a given period. For example, a system that
has an uptime of 99.9% is considered to have "three nines of availability".

What is considered to be "highly available" depends on the system's
link:./requirements.adoc[*requirements*]. A system with three nines of
availability would actually have a link:./downtime.adoc[downtime] of 8.76 hours
per year, which may be acceptable for some systems but not for others.
