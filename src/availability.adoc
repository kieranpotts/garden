= Availability (aka. reliability)

Availability is a *link:./quality-attributes.adoc[quality attribute]* of an IT system that refers to the proportion of time that a system remains operational and accessible to users, even under heavy load and even when parts of the system fail.

Availability is closely related to *link:./scalability.adoc[scalability]* and *link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[fault tolerance]*.

Availability is typically expressed as a percentage of *link:./uptime.adoc[uptime]* over a given period. For example, a system that has an uptime of 99.9% is considered to have "three nines of availability".

What is considered to be "highly available" depends on the system's *link:./requirements.adoc[requirements]*. A system with three nines of availability would actually have a *link:./downtime.adoc[downtime]* of 8.76 hours per year, which may be acceptable for some systems but not for others. 99.99% uptime (four nines) would mean a downtime of 52.56 minutes per year.
