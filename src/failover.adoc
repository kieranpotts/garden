= Failover

A failover is the process of automatically or manually switching to a
redundant or standby system, component, or network upon the failure or abnormal
termination of the previously active system, component, or network.

Failover improves the availability and *link:./scalability.adoc[scalability]* of a
system. It can help to remove *single points of failure* and ensure that a system
remains operational even if some of its components fail.
