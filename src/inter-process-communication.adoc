= Inter-process communication (IPC)

Inter-process communication (IPC) is a set of methods for exchanging data between multiple threads in one or more processes. IPC is used for communication between processes, which may be running on the same machine or on different machines.

Examples of styles of IPC include *[RPC]*, *[REST]*, *[message-passing]*, and *[shared memory] (eg. databases)*.
