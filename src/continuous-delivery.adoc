= Continuous delivery

Continuous delivery is a software development *[practice]* in which software is built and managed in such as way that it can be released to production environments at any time.

Continuous delivery is _not_ the same as *[continuous deployment]*. Continuous delivery means the software is _not automatically deployed_ to production systems, but just that you could – in theory – manually trigger an automated production deployment at a moment's notice.

The following constraints on the software delivery process help to achieve continuous deployment:

* There is always a branch of stable artifacts from which a new production-grade release can be built.
* Builds and tests are fast and reliable.
* Deployments are done frequently, in small batches.
* Deployments are highly automated.
* Rollbacks are triggered automatically if new exceptions are logged in production after a release, else operations staff are notified automatically of new exceptions.
