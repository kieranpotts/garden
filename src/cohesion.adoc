= Cohesion

Cohesion is a a *[design principle]* and a measure of the the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together. A module with high cohesion is one that groups together elements that are closely related in the *[business domain]*.

Because modules with high cohesion tend to have fewer dependencies on other modules, highly cohesive systems tend also to be highly *modular*, with low *coupling* between components.

Achieving high cohesion requires good *domain modelling*. When the domain boundaries are not well understand or well designed, cohesion tends to be low and coupling tends to be high.
