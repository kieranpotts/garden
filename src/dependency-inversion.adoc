= Dependency inversion

Dependency inversion is a *[principle]* of *link:./object-oriented-programming.adoc[object-oriented programming]* design that states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; instead both should depend on abstractions.

This reduces *[coupling]* between modules, making it easier to change one module without affecting others. It also allows for the creation of more flexible and *[reusable]* code.
