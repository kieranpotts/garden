= Resource-oriented architecture (ROA)

Resource-oriented architecture (ROA) was described by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby in their 2007 Or'Reilly book https://archive.org/details/restfulwebservic00rich_0[RESTful Web Services].

It is a style of software architecture that is based on the principles of *link:./rest.adoc[REST]*. Software components are organized around resources, which are uniquely identifiable entities that can be manipulated using a small set of well-defined operations.

ROA is described as being coupled to the web. *link:./web-oriented-architecture.adoc[Web-oriented architecture (WOA)]* described similar constraints.
