= PERT chart

A PERT chart is a visual project management tool used to map out and track tasks and timelines. The
acronym standard for Project (or Program) Evaluation and Review Technique.

In a PERT chart, boxes or circles ("nodes") are drawn to represent events or milestones. These nodes
are then connected using arrows, representing the sequence in which tasks must be completed due to
dependencies.

PERT charts are similar to [Gantt charts] in that they offer a graphical view of a project's tasks,
schedule, and timelines. PERT charts are more free-form than Gantt charts, allowing for greater
flexibility in how tasks are represented. PERT charts are also better for illustrating dependencies.
