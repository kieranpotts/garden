= Diagramming

Our industry's current bias towards *[agile]* software delivery practices has led to a preference for use of lightweight diagramming tools to create visual representations of *[system designs]*, over the production of detailed *link:./modeling.adoc[models]*.

Diagrams are often used to communicate ideas and concepts to a wider audience, including non-technical stakeholders, rather than as a pure development tool.

The *[domain language]* of diagramming tools is "boxes and arrows". This makes diagraming tools relatively easy to use. The barriers to entry are much lower than for proper modeling tools like http://staruml.io/[StarUML]. But this simplicity has some trade-offs:

* With diagrams, you can't enforce the same level of consistency in naming and relationships between components as you can with proper models.

* You can't validate, in an automated way, that diagrams are a correct representation of the code they document.

* You can't query diagrams (eg. "show me all the dependencies of component X").

* You can't auto-generate code from diagrams.

* Maintaining diagrams as the code changes is a more manual, and therefore more error-prone, process compared to maintaining models. For example, if you change the name of a class in the code, you will probably have to change it in several places in the diagrams, too. In a model, you should need to change the names of things in only one place.

Diagrams tend to be stored in either binary formats (such as images) or heavyweight plain-text formats that are difficult to diff. For these reasons, it is harder to maintain diagrams under version control systems like Git. But this is true of many modeling tools, too.

=== Diagrams-as-code solutions

Diagrams-as-code solutions are becoming increasingly popular as the plain-text syntax can be version controlled and maintained alongside the source code they document.

See *link:./diagrams-as-code.adoc[diagrams-as-code]* for a list of solutions.
