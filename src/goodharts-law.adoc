= Goodhart's law

Goodhart's law states that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a
good measure.

Consider for example a hospital that was taking too long to admit patients. A
response from management may be to set a target for 4+ hour wait times. Since
the clock starts ticking once the patient reaches the hospital, ambulance
drivers may respond by slowing down their journeys to the hospital.
