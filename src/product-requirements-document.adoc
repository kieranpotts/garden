= Product requirements document (PRD)

A *product requirements document (PRD)* is a written artifact that records all the requirements for a product. PRDs are used mostly for software products.

Typically a PRD is created from the perspective of end users and it describes at a high-level _what_ a solution should do, omitting details about _how_ it should work. Technical/implementation details are subsequently specified in a *functional specification*.

See also *[system requirements specification (SRS)]*.
