// TODO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It is typically packaged in a *distribution*, which is a particular configuration of software built around the Linux kernel.

== Linux kernel

The https://kernel.org/[Linux kernel] is a free and open-source Unix-like OS kernel, first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is core component of most Linux distributions and other operating systems such as Android.

== Linux distributions

=== Consumer-oriented distributions

*https://www.debian.org/[Debian]* is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel and today it is the foundation distribution for many Linux distributions, including the ubiquitous Ubuntu. Debian is known to be highly stable and reliable, and it is widely used on servers for this reason. For general consumers, a lot of package configuration is required to make it usable â€“ out-of-the-box it's a pretty bare-bones distribution.

*https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu]* is perhaps the most well-known Linux distribution. Based on Debian, Ubuntu is beginner-friendly, stable, and widely used. It has a large community and excellent support via its parent company, Canonical.

*https://www.linuxmint.com/[Linux Mint]* is a polished, easy-to-use alternative to Ubuntu. Based on Debian, it has a more traditional desktop environment that will feel more familiar to users coming from Windows or macOS. The focus is on providing a familiar experience out-of-the-box, with minimal setup required.

*openSUSE* is known for its powerful system management tools, and it is therefore a good choice for people who want a lot of control over the configuration of their system.

*Arch Linux* is a lightweight and flexible distribution that is known for its simplicity and customization options. It is popular among advanced users who want to build their system from the ground up. Arch Linux follows a rolling release model, meaning that users always have access to the latest software updates without needing to reinstall or upgrade the entire system.

*Manjaro* is a user-friendly distribution based on Arch Linux. It offers rolling updates but without all the complexity involved in setting up Arch.

*Pop!_OS*, developed by System76, is optimized for performance and comes with excellent support for gaming and AI/ML workflows.

*Elementary OS* focuses on providing a beautiful and intuitive user experience. It is popular among users who appreciate aesthetics and simplicity.

=== Enterprise-oriented distributions

*https://fedoraproject.org/[Fedora]* is known for integrating the latest Linux features. It's popular with early adopters, software developers, and other tech enthusiasts who want the latest innovations in Linux. Originally a continuation of the Red Hat Linux project, Fedora is now the upstream source for CentOS Stream and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

*Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)* is a commercial distribution that is widely used in enterprise environments. It is known for its stability, security, and long-term support.

*CentOS Stream*, formerly *CentOS* (which is a discontinued distribution), is a free and open-source distribution that is based on RHEL. It is popular for servers and enterprise environments due to its stability and long-term support.

*AlmaLinux* is a community-driven, open-source fork of CentOS.

*Rocky Linux* is another community-driven, open-source fork of CentOS, created by one of the original founders of CentOS.

*Oracle Linux* is a free and open-source distribution that is based on RHEL. It is optimized for Oracle software and hardware, but it can be used for general-purpose computing as well.

== Linux package managers

* APT (Ubuntu/Debian)
* DNF (Fedora)
* Pacman (Arch)
* Zypper (openSUSE)

== Security layers

* SELinux (Fedora, CentOS)
* AppArmor (Ubuntu)
* Immutable FS (Talos, Flatcar)
