= Linux

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It is typically packaged in a *distribution*, which is a particular configuration of software built around the Linux kernel.

== Linux kernel

The Linux kernel was first released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. Since then, it has been adopted by many distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

== Linux distributions

=== Consumer-oriented distributions

*Ubuntu* is perhaps the most well-known Linux distribution. It is beginner-friendly, stable, and widely used. It has a large community and excellent support.

*Fedora* is known for integrating the latest Linux features. It's popular with early adopters, software developers, and other tech enthusiasts who want the latest innovations in Linux.

*Linux Mint* is a polished, easy-to-use alternative to Ubuntu. It has a more traditional desktop environment that will feel more familiar to users coming from Windows or macOS. The focus is on providing a familiar experience out-of-the-box, with minimal setup required.

*Debian* is the foundation distribution for Ubuntu and many other distributions. It is known to be highly stable and reliable, and it is widely used on servers for this reason. For general consumers, a lot of package configuration is required to make it usable â€“ it's a pretty bare-bones distribution out-of-the-box.

*openSUSE* is known for its powerful system management tools, and it is therefore a good choice for people who want a lot of control over the configuration of their system.

*Manjaro* is a user-friendly distribution based on *Arch Linux*. It offers rolling updates without the complexity of setting up Arch manually.

*Pop!_OS*, developed by System76, is optimized for performance and comes with excellent support for gaming and AI/ML workflows.

*Elementary OS* focuses on providing a beautiful and intuitive user experience. It is popular among users who appreciate aesthetics and simplicity.

=== Enterprise-oriented distributions

*Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)* is a commercial distribution that is widely used in enterprise environments. It is known for its stability, security, and long-term support.

*CentOS* is a free and open-source distribution that is based on RHEL. It is popular for servers and enterprise environments due to its stability and long-term support.

*AlmaLinux* is a community-driven, open-source fork of CentOS.

*Rocky Linux* is another community-driven, open-source fork of CentOS, created by one of the original founders of CentOS.

*Oracle Linux* is a free and open-source distribution that is based on RHEL. It is optimized for Oracle software and hardware, but it can be used for general-purpose computing as well.

*Arch Linux* is a lightweight and flexible distribution that is known for its simplicity and customization options. It is popular among advanced users who want to build their system from the ground up. Arch Linux follows a rolling release model, meaning that users always have access to the latest software updates without needing to reinstall or upgrade the entire system.
