= Replication

Replication is the process of creating and maintaining identical copies of data across multiple
servers or nodes.

Together with *link:./sharding.adoc[sharding]*, replication is a key technique for scaling databases
and distributed systems. Sharding splits data across multiple servers, while replication duplicates
data across multiple servers.

Replication provides *link:./redundancy.adoc[redundancy]*, *link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[fault tolerance]*,
and improved data *link:./availability.adoc[availability]* in *link:./distributed-systems.adoc[distributed systems]*.
