In *[distributed systems]*, a heartbeat is a *periodic message* sent between nodes to monitor each other's health and status.

Without a heartbeat mechanism, it's hard to quickly detect failures in a distributed system, leading to:

* Delays fault detection and recovery.
* Increased downtime and errors.
* Decreased overall system reliability.
