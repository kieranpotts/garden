= Graph databases

Data is stored in nodes and edges, which represent entities and the relationships between them.

Graph databases use:

* *Nodes* to represent entities.
* *Edges* to represent relationships.
* *Properties* to store information about nodes and edges.

Examples include *Neo4j* and *Amazon Neptune*.
