= Postel's Law

Also known as the *Robustness Principle*, Postel's Law states:

____
Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.

Named after Jon Postel, one of the early pioneers of the internet, it suggests that:

* Servers (or any system component) should be tolerant of variations or errors in incoming data, such as client requests. By being forgiving, they can handle different client implementations and unexpected input gracefully.

* Servers should adhere strictly to protocols and standards when sending data. Ensuring that the data sent is accurate, well-formed, and compliant with interface definitions helps to maintain compatibility.

Applying Postel's Law can lead to more robust and interoperable systems.

However, this principle needs to be balanced against security considerations. Servers should avoid unintentionally accepting harmful or malicious input, for example.
