= Semantic diffusion

Semantic diffusion is a term https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.htm[coined by] Martin Fowler to describe the phenomenon where a term or concept looses the precision of its original meaning or definition the more widely it is used.

Fowler cites the terms "agile" and "web 2.0" as examples of terms that have lost their original semantics. Other examples include "technical debt" and "microservices".
