= Semantic diffusion

:link-fowler: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.htm

Semantic diffusion is a term {link-fowler}[coined by Martin Fowler] to describe
the phenomenon where a term or concept looses the precision of its original
meaning or definition the more widely it is used.

Fowler cites the terms "agile" and "web 2.0" as examples of terms that have lost
their original semantics. Other examples include "technical debt" and
"microservices".
