== Tools

The following tools specialize in database modeling. They are used to design database schemas, including the relationships and constraints in *[SQL databases]*. These are proper *link:./modeling.adoc[modeling]* tools, not just *link:./diagramming.adoc[diagramming]* tools, which means they can be used to generate SQL code from their models.

Some *[database administration]* tools such as https://www.heidisql.com/[HeidiSQL] and https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/[MySQL Workbench] also support visual database design.

* https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/home/[Database Markup Language (DBML)] — Open source DSL for defining and documenting database schemas and data structures. https://dbdiagram.io/[dbdiagram.io] and https://dbdocs.io/[dbdocs.io] are tools that support DBML. There's also a https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/cli[command line tool] for converting DBML to SQL table definitions, and a https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/js-module/core/[JavaScript module] for programmatically working with DBML.

* https://www.dbdesigner.net/[DB Designer] — Online database design tool.

* https://www.fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/[DbDesigner 4] — Open source design tool for MySQL databases.

* https://dbdiagram.io/[Dbdiagram.io] — Online database design tool. From data models defined in a lightweight, plain text markup language, the UI dynamically renders Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and exports SQL statements for table creation.

* https://dbschema.com/[DbSchema] — Powerful modeling tool for both SQL and NoSQL databases. Supports reverse engineering of existing databases, visual query building, generation of dummy test data, and more.

* https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd[erd] — CLI utility for generating entity-relationship diagrams from a plain-text description.

* https://hackolade.com/[Hackolade] — Data modeling tool for SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as APIs and storage formats.

* http://www.modelsphere.com/[ModelSphere] — Free and open source tool for business process modeling, data modeling, and UML modeling. Cross-platform compatible, but it requires a Java 7 Virtual Machine to be installed locally.

* https://soft-builder.com/erbuilder-data-modeler/[ER Builder Data Modeler] — Automatically generates SQL code for popular databases from ER diagrams. Desktop subscription software.

* https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/sql-data-modeler/[Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler] — Free graphical tool for designing database schemas.
