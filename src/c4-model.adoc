= C4 model

The https://c4model.com/[C4 model] is a framework for visualizing software architecture at different levels of abstraction.

The model consists of four levels:

* *Context*: Shows how your system fits into the world, including external users and systems it interacts with.

* *Container*: Depicts the high-level technology choices, showing applications, databases, and services that make up the system.

* *Component*: Zooms into individual containers to show their internal structure and key components.

* *Code*: Shows how individual components are implemented.

The "code" level is optional, and often auto-generated from actual code.

The C4 model was created by https://simonbrown.je/[Simon Brown]. Google Maps served as inspiration. Just as Google Maps allows users to zoom in and out to see different levels of detail, the C4 model provides a way to zoom in and out of software architecture models, each operating at a different level of abstraction or granularity.

The model's visual notation emphasizes simplicity, using basic boxes and lines, making the diagrams accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

== C4 modeling tools

See also *link:./modeling.adoc[Modeling]* for more modeling tool.

* https://structurizr.com/[Structurizr] — Developed by https://simonbrown.je/[Simon Brown], who also created the C4 model, Structurizr is an online diagrams-as-code tool that generates C4 models from a plain-text language, the https://docs.structurizr.com/dsl[Structurizr DSL], which is a modeling language in its own right.

* https://icepanel.io/[IcePanel] (https://docs.icepanel.io/[docs]) — Features include interactive diagrams that are zoomable into increasing levels of technical detail. Freemium SaaS. You create models of the first three levels of the C4 model – context, container, component – and then at the bottom you can link to code in GitHub or other repositories.
