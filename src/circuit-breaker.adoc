= Circuit breaker

// TODO: https://medium.com/geekculture/design-patterns-for-microservices-circuit-breaker-pattern-276249ffab33

The circuit breaker *[pattern]* is a way to handle *transient failures* in *link:./distributed-system.adoc[distributed software]*.

When requests to services fail, a circuit breaker will automatically open, preventing any further requests from being sent to the failing service. The circuit breaker will remain open for a configurable amount of time, after which it will automatically close, so allowing further requests to be sent again to the service.

Circuit breakers complement *link:./retry-mechanism.adoc[retry mechanism]*. Whereas a retry mechanism will keep retrying a failing service until it succeeds, a circuit breaker will trip when the error rate exceeds a configured threshold and it will prevent any further requests from being sent to the failing service for a configured period of time.

Both are solutions for improving *link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[fault tolerance]*, and the two solutions work particularly well in combination. If a service is failing, it is likely that it will continue to fail for a period of time, until its failure mode is resolved through *link:./disaster-recovery.adoc[disaster recovery]* mechanisms. While disaster recovery is ongoing, a circuit breaker will help to prevent the recovering system from being overwhelmed by retries.

Scenario: OrderService and PaymentService

Imagine you have an e-commerce application with two services:

1. OrderService: Handles customer orders.
2. PaymentService: Processes payments for these orders.

Problems Without Circuit Breaker

• Service Overload:

If the PaymentService starts to fail (e.g., due to a high load or a bug), every request to the OrderService that tries to call the PaymentService will also fail.

This can lead to a cascading failure where the OrderService is overwhelmed by failed requests and cannot serve other customers effectively.

• Slow Responses:

If the PaymentService is slow to respond, the OrderService might wait for a long time before timing out, leading to a poor user experience.

• Resource Waste:

Repeatedly trying to call a failing PaymentService wastes resources and can slow down the entire system.

How the Circuit Breaker Pattern Helps

The Circuit Breaker pattern solves these problems by wrapping the calls to the PaymentService in a "circuit breaker."

Here's how it works:

• Closed State: Initially, the circuit breaker is in a closed state, allowing requests to pass through to the PaymentService.

• Open State: If the PaymentService fails too often within a specified period, the circuit breaker "trips" and moves to an open state.

In this state, calls to the PaymentService immediately failed without trying to make a real request. This prevents the PaymentService from being overwhelmed and allows it time to recover.

• Half-Open State:

After a timeout period, the circuit breaker moves to a half-open state. It allows a few test requests to see if the PaymentService has recovered.

If the test requests are successful, the circuit breaker returns to the closed state. If they fail, it goes back to the open state.
