= Continuous deployment

Continuous deployment is an advanced software delivery *[practice]* in which every change that goes through an automated *[delivery pipeline]* gets put into production automatically.

Continuous deployment allows for multiple updates to production services to be made every working day.

Continuous deployment is particular effective in the context of *[cross-functional teams]* that are responsible for the entire software delivery process, from design and development to deployment and operation in production. Continuous deployment enables teams to deploy changes, monitor the changes in production, and roll back, revert, or abort deployments if necessary.
