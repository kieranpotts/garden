= Rate limiting

Rate limiting is a *[system design]* strategy that helps protect services from being overwhelmed by too many requests from a single user or client.

== Rate limiting algorithms

* *Token bucket*: Allows bursts of traffic within overall rate limit.
* *Leaky bucket*: Smooths traffic flow at constant rate.
* *Fixed window counter*: Limits requests in fixed time intervals.
* *Sliding window log*: Tracks requests within rolling time window.
* *Sliding window counter*: Smooths rate between adjacent fixed windows.
