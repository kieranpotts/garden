= Bus factor

The *bus factor* or *truck factor* is a measure of the risk associated with the concentration of knowledge (*knowledge silos*) within a team or organization. A high bus factor means that a team's productivity, or even their ability to continue with their work at all, would be significantly impacted if one or two key people are incapacitated (hit by a bus, metaphorically).
