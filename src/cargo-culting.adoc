= Cargo-culting

Cargo-culting refers to a phenomenon observed in human behavior in which people imitate the superficial aspects of a process or system without understanding its underlying principles, hoping to achieve similar results.

The term originated in the  early 20th century among indigenous communities in Melanesia (South Pacific islands like Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea). These communities observed Western colonizers and military personnel receiving vast amounts of goods (cargo) via ships and planes. Believing these goods were spiritually or ancestrally intended for them, they began performing rituals — like building mock airstrips or control towers — hoping to summon cargo themselves.

In modern contexts, "cargo culting" describes mimicking the form of something successful without grasping its function. This behavior is common in various fields, including scientific research (following experimental procedures without understanding the theory) and business (adopting buzzwords or frameworks without meaningful implementation).

In the field of software development, cargo culting manifests as copying code patterns or tools without understanding their purpose. It is perhaps most commonly seen in the adoption of "agile" methodologies, where teams may implement practices like daily stand-ups or sprints without embracing the core values of collaboration and iteration – the underlying principles of agile software development.
