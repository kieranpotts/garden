= Execution model

An execution model in *[computer programming]* defines how a program's instructions are processed
and executed by a computer. It specifies the behavior of the elements of a programming language, and
determines the order in which operations are performed.

An execution model helps in understanding how a computer program will behave when it's code is
compiled and executed.

Execution models may be sequential or parallel. In a *sequential execution model*, instructions are
executed one after the other, in the order in which they appear in the code. In a *parallel
execution model*, multiple instructions may be executed simultaneously.

Parallel execution models are made possible by *[multi-threaded]* and
*link:./distributed-system.adoc[distributed computing]* environments.
