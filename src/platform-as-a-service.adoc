= Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a *[web hosting]* platform
that allows customers to deploy, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity
of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. Servers, storage, and networking are all
operated by the PaaS provider, allowing developers to focus on writing code and building
applications.

Some PaaS systems feature *[integrated development environments (IDEs)]* and other tools to support
management of the complete development and operations life cycle.

Examples of PaaS include:

* Microsoft Azure App Service
* Google App Engine
* Heroku.

*link:./serverless-computing.adoc[Serverless computing]* is a type of PaaS that abstracts the
underlying infrastructure even further, such that even scaling and resource allocation are fully
managed by the *link:./cloud-service-providers.adoc[cloud service provider]*.
