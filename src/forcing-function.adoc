= Forcing function

A *forcing function* can refer to several concepts, but generally it describes something that compels or forces a specific action or outcome. It can be a design element or a behavioral constraint, with the aim of influencing or directing a process.

In the context of software design, a forcing function is often used to describe a design pattern or user interface element that requires users to take certain actions before proceeding.

In a project management context, it can refer to any strategy that applies constraints or sets commitments or any other kind of catalyst that guides behavior and particular steps to be taken to achieve a desired outcome.
