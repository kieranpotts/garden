= Big bang

In a *[migration]* strategy, a "big bang" cutover involves switching over to a replacement system in a single step. This is contrasted with phased or parallel migration strategies, which involve incremental transitions.

Generally, big bang migrations should be avoided due to the high costs and risks. However, sometimes they are unavoidable â€“ for example, if a system is being recreated on an entirely different technology stack.
