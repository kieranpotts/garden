= Platform engineering

Platform engineering is a discipline that focuses on building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and tools that enable software development teams to deliver applications and services more efficiently. It involves creating a software delivery platform that abstracts away the complexities of the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code and delivering value to customers.

Especially in larger organizations, platform engineering can help to streamline the development process by providing a consistent and reliable environment for developers to work in. This can include everything from managing cloud resources and container orchestration to providing CI/CD pipelines and monitoring tools.
