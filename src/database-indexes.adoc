= Database indexes

A database index is a super-efficient *lookup table* that allows a database to find data much
faster.

It holds the indexed column values along with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table.

Without an index, the database might have to scan every single row in a massive table to find what
you want â€“ a painfully slow process. But with an index, the database can jump directly to the
corresponding row using the index's pointers.
