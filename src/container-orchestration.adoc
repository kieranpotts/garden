= Container orchestration

Container orchestration refers to the automated management of *link:./containerization.adoc[containerized]* applications. Container orchestration systems manage the life cycle of containers, from deployment to destruction. Features of container orchestration include:

* *Deployment*: Automating the process of launching containers, potentially across multiple environments.

* *Auto-scaling*: Adjusting the number of container instances dynamically based on current demand or predefined policies.

* *Service discovery*: Automatically detecting and registering new services.

* *Networking*: Managing network connectivity between containers, allowing for cross-container communication.

* *Load balancing*: Distributing *link:./load.adoc[workloads]* evenly across containers, to optimize resource use and performance.

* *Scheduling*: Determining the most efficient location for container deployment based on available resources.

* *Storage mounting*: Attaching storage volumes to containers as needed.

* *Monitoring*: Keeping track of container performance and health, providing insights for maintenance and optimization.

* *Self-healing*: Automatically detecting and restarting failed containers, maintaining high availability and reliability.

The most popular container orchestration system is *link:./kubernetes.adoc[Kubernetes]*. Others
include:

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/[Docker Swarm]: Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool. It is simple to set up and integrates seamlessly with Docker, making it a good choice for smaller-scale deployments.

* https://www.nomadproject.io/[Nomad]: Developed by HashiCorp, Nomad is designed to be an easier-to-use alternative to Kubernetes. It can be used to deploy and manage both containers and non-containerized applications across cloud platforms and on-premises infrastructure.

* https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[OpenShift]: Built on top of Kubernetes, Red Hat's OpenShift provides additional features and tools for developers and operators.

* https://mesos.apache.org/[Apache Mesos]: Mesos is a cluster management and resource scheduling system. It abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other resources, across a cluster, allowing deployed applications to share resources dynamically and efficiently. Supporting Docker, Mesos can be used to manage containerized applications.

*link:./cloud-service-providers.adoc[Cloud service providers]* also offer managed container orchestration services. Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is similar but is designed specifically for running Kubernetes on AWS. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is Google's managed Kubernetes service, and Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Microsoft's equivalent.

Kubernetes-as-a-Service platforms include https://www.rancher.com/[Rancher] and https://www.portainer.io/[Portainer].
