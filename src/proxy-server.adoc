= Proxy server

A proxy server acts as a *gateway* between you and the internet. It's an intermediary server,
separating end users from the websites they browse. Proxy servers provide varying levels of
functionality, security, and privacy depending on the use case.

Common types of proxy servers are:

* *Forward proxy*: Sits in front of a client and forwards requests to the internet on behalf of
  the client.

* *Reverse proxy*: Sits in front of a web server and forwards requests from clients to the server.
