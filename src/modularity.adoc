= Modularity

// TODO: A static *[quality]* of a software system.

// Modularity is related to *[abstraction]*, which is a general concept in software design. Modularity is a specific application of abstraction in software design, where the system is divided into smaller, self-contained modules that can be developed and maintained independently, and which hide their *[complexity]* from other parts of the system - so that users of the module have minimal *cognitive overhead* to understand how to use the module.
