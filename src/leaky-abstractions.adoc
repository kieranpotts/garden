= Leaky abstractions

Joel Spolsky wrote a famous {link-spolsky}[blog post in 2002] titled "The Law of Leaky Abstractions".
The idea he presents is that abstractions can never be perfect, and consumers of an abstraction will
always need to understand, to some extent, the underlying implementation of that abstraction. If
they don't, they will struggle to resolve issues when the implementation inevitably leaks through
the abstraction.
