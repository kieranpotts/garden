= Micro front-end

A micro front-end is an *[architectural pattern]* for web development, whereby independently-developed front-end application are composed into a greater whole.

The pattern is analogous to a microservices approach on the *[server-side]*, but for *[client-side]* *[single-page applications]*.

It provides a solution to *[decomposition]* and routing for large, complex web UIs.
