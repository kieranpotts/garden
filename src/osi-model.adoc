= OSI model

The *Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model* is a conceptual reference model developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that is used to understand the implementation of network protocols.

The OSI model is divided into seven layers, each of which serves a specific purpose in the process of data communication and interacts with the layers above and below it. The layers are:

* *Layer 1: Physical layer*

  ** Responsible for the physical connection between devices.
  ** Deals with the transmission of raw data over a physical medium (eg., cables, radio waves).
  ** Examples: Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth.

* *Layer 2: Data link layer*

  ** Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
  ** Ensures reliable communication between directly connected devices.
  ** Examples: Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11).

* *Layer 3: Network layer*

  ** Responsible for routing data packets between devices across different networks.
  ** Determines the best path for data to travel from source to destination.

* *Layer 4: Transport layer*

  ** Responsible for end-to-end communication and data flow control.
  ** Ensures complete data transfer and error recovery.
  ** Examples: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

* *Layer 5: Session layer*

  ** Responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between applications.
  ** Ensures that data is properly synchronized and organized.

* *Layer 6: Presentation layer*

  ** Responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression.
  ** Ensures that data is in a format that can be understood by the application layer.
  ** Examples: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS).

* *Layer 7: Application layer*

  ** Responsible for providing network services to end-user applications.
  ** Interfaces directly with user applications and provides network services.
  ** Examples: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

Of these, layers 4 (network transport) and 7 (application) are the most important for network application development. Layer 4 is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted reliably and securely, while layer 7 is responsible for providing network services to end-user applications.
