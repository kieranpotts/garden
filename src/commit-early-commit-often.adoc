= Commit early, commit often

This is a software development *[principle]* that states that developers should commit their code to a version control system frequently, rather than waiting until a large amount of work has been completed.

This is synonymous with the practice of *[continuous integration]*, where developers integrate their code into a shared repository multiple times a day
