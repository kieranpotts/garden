= ACID principles

ACID refers to a set of properties of database management systems that guarantee that database
*[transactions]* are processed reliably and consistently, ensuring *[data integrity]*.

ACID is an acronym for:

* *Atomicity*: Transactions are fully completed, or not at all. If one part of a transaction fails,
  the entire transaction fails, and the database is left unchanged.

* *Consistency*: Only transactions that abide by constraints and rules are written to the database.
  This ensures that the database is always in a valid state. A transaction will always result in the
  state of the database transitioning from one valid state to another.

* *Isolation*: Transactions are processed independently and securely, without interference from
  other transactions.

* *Durability*: Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain in the system permanently,
  even in the event of a system failure.
