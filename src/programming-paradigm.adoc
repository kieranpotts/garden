= Programming paradigm

A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to programming that dictates how programmers structure and write code to solve problems. It encompasses a set of principles, techniques, and patterns for organizing code and thinking about program execution.

Common programming paradigms are:

* *Imperative programming*: Focuses on explicitly describing the steps the computer must take to achieve a desired state. Procedural programming is a sub-category of imperative programming.

* *Declarative programming*: Focuses on describing what the program should accomplish without explicitly listing commands or steps.

* *Functional programming (FP)*: A sub-category of declarative programming, functional programming emphasizes the use of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data.

* *Object-oriented programming (OOP)*: Organizes code into objects that contain both data and methods, promoting encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

* *Logic programming*: Uses formal logic to express computations, where the desired result is declared as the answer to a query about a system of facts and rules.
