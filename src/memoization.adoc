= Memoization

Memoization is a *[design pattern]* in which the result of a function's execution is cached, and
the cached result is returned when the function is subsequently called with identical inputs,
thus avoiding *[redundant]* computation.

Memoization is a form of *[caching]*, but it is specifically used to optimize the performance of
functions that are computationally expensive or time-consuming.
