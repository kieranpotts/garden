WebSockets is a *[communication protocol]* that provides full-duplex, real-time, and bidirectional communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection.

WebSockets are widely used in wen applications such as chat systems or real-time collaboration tools, where instant and continuous data exchange between clients and servers is required.

// See also *long polling* and *Server-Sent Events (SSE)*, which are alternative techniques for achieving similar functionality.
