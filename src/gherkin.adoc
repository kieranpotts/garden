= Gherkin

Gherkin is a https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html[business-readable domain-specific language],
which is intended for specifying and documenting software requirements.

Gherkin specifies a software system on a feature-by-feature basis from the point of view of
different groups of users. The objective is to provide a unified specification that can be written
and understood by technical and non-technical people alike. As such, Gherkin provides a common
language for product managers and developers to discuss and document the business requirements.

Gherkin can also be parsed by machines and used as the basis for automated acceptance testing.
