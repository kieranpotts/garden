= Bulkhead

The bulkhead *[design pattern]* is an architectural pattern used to improve the *[fault tolerance]* of *link:./distributed-system.adoc[distributed software]*.

The pattern is inspired by the construction of ships, in which the hulls are divided into watertight compartments called bulkheads, to prevent the entire ship from sinking if one compartment is breached.

In software, the bulkhead pattern involves isolating components of an application into separate "bulkheads" to limit the impact of failures. If a component of one bulkhead fails, it will not impact the running of components in other bulkheads.

By isolating failures, the bulkhead pattern helps prevent cascading failures.
