= Abstraction

// TODO: Abstraction is a general concept in software design.

Abstraction simplifies code interaction and reduces complexity.

The concept of abstraction is incorporated into the programming structures supported by *link:./object-oriented-programming.adoc[object-oriented programming]* languages. In OOP, classes are a built-in language feature for implementing abstraction in code. Classes hide implementation details and exposes only the necessary information to use a software component.
