Serverless computing, or just "serverless", is a cloud computing model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to operate the underlying servers. Instead, the *link:./cloud-service-providers.adoc[cloud service provider (CSP)]* manages every aspect of the infrastructure, including resource allocation, auto-scaling, and server maintenance.

Serverless computing services are a further abstraction of the *link:./platform-as-a-service.adoc[Platform as a Service (PaaS)]* model. In PaaS, application developers are still responsible for managing the application environment, including system configuration and updates, and for implementing scaling and load balancing. The CSP is responsible only for managing the underlying infrastructure and for basic operational needs.

The term "serverless" is a bit of a misnomer, as servers are still involved in running the code, but they are entirely abstracted away from the application developers.

Serverless computing is *link:./event-driven-architecture.adoc[event-driven]*, meaning that functions are triggered by specific events or requests, such as HTTP requests, changes in a database, or messages from a queue. Developers write small, single-purpose functions that are executed in response to these events. Serverless computing is well-suited to applications that react to events, such as those that handle real-time data streams, and where rapid scalability is required.

// TODO: See also *[Function-as-a-Service]*.

Serverless is not without its challenges. Potential issues include cold start times, where the platform takes time to initialize a function, and risks associated with vendor lock-in, as applications can be tightly coupled to the CSP's platform.

Other features of serverless computing include:

* *Auto-scaling*: Resources are automatically scale up or down based on application demand, without any intervention from the developer.

* *Pay-as-you-go*: Customers pay only for the compute resources they use, typically billed on a per-invocation basis.

* *Automated deployment*: Tools, integrated into the hosting platform, allow for quick and easy deployments.

Examples of serverless platforms include:

* AWS Lambda
* Azure Functions
* Google Cloud Functions
