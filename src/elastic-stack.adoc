= Elastic stack

The "Elastic" stack, formerly known as the ELK stack, is a family of three software products:

* Elasticsearch
* Logstash
* Kibana

The Elastic stack is used to aggregate logs from systems and applications, to analyze those logs, and to create visualizations from them.

Use cases include visualizing application and infrastructure monitoring data, troubleshooting production issues, and security analytics.
