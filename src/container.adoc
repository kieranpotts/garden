= Container

A container can be thought of as a lightweight *link:./virtual-machine.adoc[virtual machine]*. Unlike a virtual machine, which loads a full operating system, a container shares a kernel with the host OS. Native features of the host OS are used to create a virtual environment for the containerized application to run in, creating a similar degree of isolation as a VM, but with much less overhead.

See *link:./containerization.adoc[containerization]* and *link:./virtualization.adoc[virtualization]* for more notes on the differences between containers and VMs.
