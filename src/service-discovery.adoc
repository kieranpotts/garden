= Service discovery

Service discovery is a mechanism that allows services in a *[distributed system]* to find and
communicate with each other dynamically.

It hides the complex details of where services are located, so they can interact without knowing
each other's exact network spots.

A *service registry* is used to maintain a record of all services available in a network. A
service registry will typically act as the *[source of truth]* for service locations. When a service
is added or removed, the registry is updated accordingly.
