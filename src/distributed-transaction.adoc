= Distributed transaction

A *distributed transaction* is a single logical operation that spans multiple databases or data sources – which are typically located on different servers within a network – guaranteeing *[atomicity]* in distributed systems.

A distributed transaction is a type of *link:./transaction.adoc]* that ensures that all operations across a *[distributed system]*, such as *[microservices]*, are completed successfully, or none at all, maintaining the *[data integrity]* of the overall system.

For example, in a distributed system, placing an order might involve charging the customer's payment method, reserving stock, updating the inventory, scheduling delivery, and sending a confirmation email. If any of these operations fail, the entire transaction should be rolled back to prevent inconsistent state.

Some databases support distributed transactions natively, but otherwise implementation requires additional tools. *link:./phased-commit.adoc[Phased commits]*, such as the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol or three-phase commit (3PC) protocol, are commonly used to manage distributed transactions. *link:./saga.adoc[Sagas]* are another approach that can be used to manage long-running distributed transactions without relying on traditional locking or phased commit protocols.
