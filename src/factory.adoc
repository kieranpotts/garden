= Factory

A factory is a *design pattern* in which a class or method is dedicated to the task of creating other objects. Factories encapsulate the knowledge needed for complex object creation.

When the construction of an object becomes overly complex, or where it requires knowledge of the object's internal data structures, it is a good practice to create a factory to simplify and abstract away the assembly operation.
