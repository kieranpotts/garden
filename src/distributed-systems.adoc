= Distributed systems

A distributed system is a computer system whose components are located on lots
of different computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by
passing messages between themselves over a network.

An individual computer program that runs within a distributed system is called
a *distributed program*, and *distributed programming* is the process of
developing and maintaining such programs. The term *distributed computing* can
refer to distributed systems and also to the field of computer science that
studies them.

Examples of distributed systems include service-oriented architecture (SOA)
systems, massively multiplayer online games, and peer-to-peer applications.
Message passing systems include HTTP, RPC-like connectors, and message queues.
