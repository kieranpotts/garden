== Database query optimization benefits

* *Performance*: Optimized queries return results faster. This is particularly important for applications with high traffic or large databases.

* *Availability*: Slow queries can lead to system bottlenecks and crashes. Optimized queries help maintain system availability, reducing downtime.

* *Resource efficiency*: Efficient queries consumer fewer CPU and memory resources.

* *Cost savings*: By minimizing resource usage, operational costs can be reduced.

For businesses relying heavily on data analytics, query optimization may provide more timely insights, potentially leading to better decision-making.
