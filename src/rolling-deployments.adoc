= Rolling deployments

Rolling deployments are a strategy for updating a running server application without *[downtime]*.

Rolling updates are achieved by having multiple instances of the application and updating the instances incrementally â€“ a few at a time, not all at once.

This way, the application remains *[available]* throughout the deployment process.

A *[load balancer]* is commonly used to implement rolling deployments. The load balancer is configured to remove instances from the pool of available servers, update them, and then add them back to the pool.

Rolling deployment allows for *[continuous deployment]* of lots of *micro releases*, each of which never implements any *breaking changes*. By releasing small changes often, we can mitigate many of the risks associated with shipping large changesets.

However, because each release requires multiple steps, it becomes impractical to do rolling deployments manually. Thus, a high degree of automation is required, using a *[deployment pipeline]*.
