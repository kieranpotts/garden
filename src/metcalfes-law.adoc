= Metcalfe's Law

Metcalfe's Law is a principle in *network theory* that states that the value is a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users (or nodes). The more users that join a network, the number of potential connections between them increases exponentially, increasing the value of the network for each individual user.

This law underpins the economics of social networks, email, phone systems, and other network systems.

While Metcalfe's Law captures the exponential growth in value of network systems, is doesn't account for negative effects of network growth, such as congestion of communication, decreasing quality fo connections, and other negative externalities that can reduce the value of the network.
