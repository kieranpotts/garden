= Content delivery networks (CDNs)

A content delivery network (CDN) is a type of *link:./caching.adoc[cache]* that stores copies of
digital files in multiple geographic locations, to reduce latency and improve the speed with which
content can be downloaded by clients.

// TODO: Two types: pull-based CDNs, which means the CDN pulls objects out of *[blob storage]*
// only when those objects are requested and the existing cache, if any, is stale; or push-based
// CDNs, which means the CDN is pre-populated with objects from the origin server.
