= Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a data integration process that combines data from multiple sources into a single, consistent data store. This process involves extracting data from source systems, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a target system, often a data warehouse.
