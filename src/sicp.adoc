= Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_, also known as SICP or the "wizard book", by Hal Abelson and Jerry Sussman, is a classic book in computer science that introduces fundamental concepts of programming.

The book is still in print and is also available https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html[for free online].

The book starts out by introducing the base elements of programming – values, names, binding, control, and so on – and then expands to explore a breadth of topics including:

* Lambda abstraction and higher-order computation
* Complex structures, including those with embedded computational content
* Modularity
* Mutability
* Streams
* Lazy evaluation
* Interpreter and compiler construction
* Storage management, garbage collection, and virtual memory
* Machine code
* Domain-specific languages
