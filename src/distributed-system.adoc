= Distributed system

A *distributed system* is a general term for any network of computers working as one coherent system. Distributed systems include *[cloud computing]* services and *[peer-to-peer networks]*.

A computer program that is partitioned across multiple nodes in a distributed system is called a *distributed program* or *distributed software*. Components of a distributed program are located on multiple networked computers, and the components coordinate their actions by passing messages between themselves over the network. Examples of distributed software include applications like *Hadoop* (for *[big data]* processing), *Kubernetes* (for *[container orchestration]*), and *Cassandra* (a *[distributed database]*). Most *[web applications]* are also distributed programs. At the very least, web applications partition their processing between a *[client and server]*. The server-side application may be further partitioned into a *[service-oriented architecture]* such as *[microservices]*.

*Distributed programming* is the process of developing and maintaining distributed programs. *Distributed computing* is the field of *[computer science]* that studies distributed systems.

== Designing distributed systems

Most large-scale systems are naturally distributed. That's because *link:./monolith.adoc[monoliths]*, as they grow in scope and load, become more *link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[brittle]* and harder to *[maintain]* and *[scale]*, so the natural tendency is towards breaking them down into lots of smaller and simpler applications that can each be developed, deployed, scaled, and optimized independently — a process known as *[decomposition]*.

But distribution of processing and data has significant *[trade-offs]* in *[system design]*.

Although individual units within a distributed system may be simpler and more *[resilient]* due to increased *[isolation]*, overall a distributed system will always have a higher degree of *[accidental complexity]* and more *[points of failure]* than a comparable single-node system. Distributed software is inherently *[brittle]* because you're introducing internal network calls, which are subject to *link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[network failures]* and greater operational constraints like *[latency]* and *[bandwidth]*. Reasoning about *link:./concurrency.adoc[concurrency]*, managing *link:./consistency.adoc[data consistency]*, and designing *link:./monitoring.adoc[monitoring]* solutions are other concerns that are particularly challenging in distributed software design.

Distributed programming is hard.

The main challenges in designing distributed software are:

* *Fault tolerance*: *[Fault tolerance]* is a key *link:./quality-attributes.adoc[quality attribute]* in distributed systems, and needs to be treated as a first-class concern in the *link:./system-design.adoc[system design]*. Distributed software is subject to a wide range of potential failure modes, including network failures, delayed messages, and node crashes. The principle of *[designing for failure]* means designing each service in a way that it can tolerate failures in dependent services. For example, if an email service goes offline, emails should be queued for delivery and sent later when the email service comes back online. Asynchronous communication patterns, and design patterns such as *[circuit breakers]* and *[bulkheads]*, help to improve the fault tolerance of distributed systems by isolating failures, and so preventing failures in one component from cascading into other components. And *[disaster recovery]* planning can ensure that services quickly recover (in an automated way) from failures.

* *Latency and bandwidth*: *[Latency]* and *[bandwidth]* are two key performance metrics in distributed systems. Latency is the time it takes for a message to travel from one node to another, while bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given time period. In distributed systems, latency and bandwidth are affected by network congestion, distance between nodes, and the number of hops a message must take to reach its destination. These are not considerations in single-node systems, where all components run in the same process.

* *Concurrency and consistency*: Because distributed systems generally use asynchronous communication between services, managing *[concurrency]* and ensuring *link:./consistency.adoc[eventual consistency]* are also key design concerns. *link:./cap-theorem.adoc[CAP theorem]* is relevant in distributed systems that *[replicate]* data between nodes.

* *Observability*: *[Monitoring]*, *[logging]*, and *[debugging]* all become much more complex in distributed systems. *[Observability]* and especially *[distributed tracing]* tools are specifically designed to address these challenges.

* *[Testing]*, too, is much more challenging in distributed systems. It is harder, for example, to do proper integration tests to validate a whole system, compared to monolithic systems where all the components run in the same process. There tends to be increased reliance upon service mocks, which reduces confidence in correctness of the tests.

For these reasons, distributed computing should be avoided until it is required to solve specific problems, such as *link:./scalability.adoc[scalability]* or *link:./fault-tolerance.adoc[fault tolerance]*. Better to start with a *link:./modular-monolith.adoc[modular monolith]*, with scalability planned into the design from the start, and extract independent services incrementally – see *link:./microservices.adoc[microservices]* for more detailed notes on the topic of *[decomposition]* of a system to a distributed design.

== The eight fallacies of distributed software

Distributed software design requires a particular set of *[design principles]* and *[systems thinking]*.

The eight fallacies of distributed computing are a set of assertions that describe false assumptions that are often made by computer programmers who are new to distributed computing. These fallacies https://nighthacks.com/jag/res/Fallacies.html[were observed] by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_Peter_Deutsch[Peter Deutsch] _et al_ at Sun Microsystems, and published online in 1994. (The list extended four fallacies previously identified by Bill Joy and Dave Lyon, while James Gosling — another Sun Fellow and the inventor of *[Java]* — added the eight fallacy in 1997.)

The eight fallacies are:

1. *The network is reliable*: The effect of making this assumption is that distribution programs are written with little *[error handling]* for network errors. Network errors can occur for a variety of reasons, including power failure, hardware failures, network congestion (including from *[denial-of-service]* attacks), and software errors in the downstream services. A network error is any category of error that prevents a component from communicating with another component running on another node. If applications are not designed to handle network errors, they may not be able to recover from those errors, with the result being the application "hanging" or crashing, losing data, or entering an inconsistent or incorrect state. Indirect *[asynchronous]* *[inter-process communication]*, hardware and software *[redundancy]*, and logic such as *[timeouts]* and *[retries]*, can mitigate the effects of network errors.

2. *Latency is zero*: Latency is typically pretty good in LANs, but it deteriorates quickly when you move to WANs or public networks (like the Internet). We typically develop and test our distributed applications in local networks, and some dependencies may be mocked. Production infrastructure is often more geographically dispersed, and therefore has higher latency. It is easy, therefore, for developers to make the assumption that network calls are instantaneous (zero latency). Modern programming constructs that abstract network calls behind in-memory objects also contribute to this false assumption. If the design allows for unbounded network traffic, the application is at risk of performing badly in production environments.

3. *Bandwidth is infinite*: Ignoring bandwidth limitations can lead to network congestion (*[bottlenecks]*). Parkinson's Law states that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". A similar pattern is seen with consumption of available bandwidth in computer networks. Network bandwidth has improved thousands-of-fold over the decades, but the effect has been that we have used up much of that bandwidth with larger payloads. Rich web application interfaces, audio and video streaming, and VoIP are examples of modern applications that consume large amounts of bandwidth. As with network latency, in production environments there may be constraints on bandwidth that our beyond our control. We should use bandwidth wisely, designing our payloads to maximize network transfer efficiency, and use *[compression]* and *[caching]* to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.

4. *The network is secure*: Assuming that internal networks are secure can open up vulnerabilities. A related assumption is that the third-parties you communicate with are trustworthy. Yet in many distributed software systems a "moat and castle" approach is taken to network security: once the perimeter security is breached, the internal networks are left vulnerable. Best practice is to enable end-to-end encryption throughout a network, and for all services to distrust input from other services (including other services in the same internal network).

5. *Topology doesn't change*: Changes in network topology can have effects on both bandwidth and latency issues. When upi deploy an application in the wild, the network topology is usually outside of your control. The operations team may add and remove servers, and make other changes to the network configuration, over time. And server and network faults can cause routing changes. Distributed applications should be designed to be resilient to changes in network topology. This means not depending on services being available in specific locations (IP addressess), instead dynamically discovering routes to target endpoints. *[Service discovery]* is a common pattern. In addition, DNS names should be used instead of IP addresses, with a central DNS server managing routing tables (the mapping of names to IP addresses).

6. *There is only one administrator*: A common assumption in distributed software design is that there will always be one single administrator who is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the entire system. In reality, different people are more likely to be responsible for different parts. This is particularly true where components of a distribute program are operated by third parties external to the main organization. Without a single authority, there is a risk of conflicting policies and procedures being implemented. For example, upgrades to database management systems may require corresponding changes to the configuration of object-relational mapping code. And system administrators may change disk quotas or set more limited privileges for users, which may inadvertently impact some operations of the application logic. Multiple strategies are needed to mitigate all these risks. *[Monitoring]* and *[alerting]* are essential. *[Staging]* environments can be used to test changes before they are deployed to production. And *[canary releases]* can be used to test new versions of software in production, with a small subset of users, before rolling out the changes to all users. All these things help, but there is no silver bullet here.

7. *Transport cost is zero*: The "hidden" costs of building and maintaining a network or subnet are not trivial. There are costs associated with buying and configuring routers, securing the network, leasing bandwidth for internet connections, and operating and maintaining the network. Even moving transport from the application level to the transport level is not free, as there are costs associated with *[marshaling]* (serializing information into bits, to get data onto the wire), which consumes compute resources and adds latency. Transport costs should be factored into system designs for any high-volume distributed system.

8. *The network is homogeneous*: If a system assumes a homogeneous network, then it can lead to the same problems that result from the first three fallacies. Solution architects should prefer to use interoperable standards and technologies, to ensure that the system can work with a variety of different platforms and maintain compatibility with future platforms to which it may, one day, be migrated.
