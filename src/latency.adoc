= Latency

Latency refers to the time it takes for a single operation or request to complete.

Low latency means faster response times and a more responsive system.

High latency can lead to lag and poor user experience.

As a *link:./quality-attributes.adoc[quality attribute]*, latency is often paired with
*link:./throughput.adoc[throughput]*, which refers to the number of operations a system can handle
in a given amount of time.
