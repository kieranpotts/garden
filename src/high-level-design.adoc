= High-level design (HLD)

High-level design (HLD) focuses on the overall architecture and structure of a system, while low-level design (LLD) provides detailed specifications for individual components.

HLD provides the "big picture" view, outlining major components and their interactions, while LLD defines the specific implementation details of each component.
