= Dependency injection

*Dependency injection* is a *design principle* that states:

* High-level modules SHOULD NOT depend on low-level modules. Both SHOULD instead depend on
  abstractions.

* Abstractions SHOULD NOT depend on details. Details – concrete implementations – SHOULD depend
  on abstractions.

Thus, both the high-level module and its low-level dependency MUST depend on the same abstraction.
This design principle inverts the way people naturally think about *[object-oriented programming]*
as a mean of composing complex programs from lots of smaller, simpler components.

Dependency injection is one possible solution to achieving
*link:inversion-of-control.adoc[Inversion of control (IoC)]*.

Numerous *design patterns* can be used to implement dependency injection, notably
*dependency injection containers* (DICs) and *service locators*.
