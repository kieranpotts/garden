= Domain model

In *link:./domain-driven-design.adoc[domain-driven design]*, a domain model is a key artifact that captures the *link:./domain.adoc[domain]* of a software system, its subdomains, and the relationships between the subdomains.

A domain model is a system of abstractions that describe all aspects of a domain, which itself consists of _selected_ features of the real world context that are relevant to the software requirements. A model should contain just enough information to be a useful reference point when solving problems in that domain using software.

Models help us to deal with the *[essential complexity]* of software systems.
