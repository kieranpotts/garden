= Black-box testing

Black box testing is a method of software testing where the tester evaluates the functionality of a software application without looking at the internal code structure, implementation details, or internal execution paths. The focus instead is on the inputs and outputs of the software system, ensuring that it behaves as expected according to the specifications.

Thus, black box testing relies on external descriptions of the system-under-tests, such as its requirements specifications and design documents. The goal is to test the software from the user's perspective, to ensure that requirements are met.
