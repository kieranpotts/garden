= Non-functional requirements (NFRs)

Non-functional requirements are *link:./requirements.adoc[requirements]* that specify the expected
*link:./quality-attributes.adoc[quality attributes]* of a system.

For example, if a system is expected to be *link:./availability.adoc[highly available]*, an NFR
may specify an average monthly uptime of 99.99%. And if a system is expected to have
*link:./latency.adoc[low latency]*, an NFR may specify a maximum response time of 500ms for reads
and 1000ms for writes.
