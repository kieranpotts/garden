= Non-functional requirements (NFRs)

Non-functional requirements are *link:./requirements.adoc[requirements]* that specify the expected *link:./quality-attributes.adoc[quality attributes]* of a system.

*link:./acceptance-criteria.adoc[Acceptance criteria]* are derived from NFRs. For example, if a system is expected to be *link:./availability.adoc[highly available]*, an NFR may specify a requirement for the system to achieve an average monthly uptime of 99.99%. If a system is expected to have *link:./latency.adoc[low latency]*, an NFR may specify a maximum response time of 500ms for reads and 1000ms for writes. These are measurable criteria that can be tested to verify that a system meets its non-functional requirements.

Non-functional requirements are sometimes called *quality requirements* or *cross-functional requirements (CFRs)*, the latter indicating that qualities such as performance, availability, and security are *[cross-cutting concerns]* that cut through the whole system design.
