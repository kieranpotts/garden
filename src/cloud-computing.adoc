= Cloud computing

Cloud computing is a computing model that enables on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (eg. networks, servers, storage, and applications) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.

Cloud computing is a synonym for *data center* based computing through high bandwidth networks. It is closely connected to *virtualization*.

In many ways, modern cloud computing is a return to the roots of computing. In the 1960s, mainframe computers provided computing power to multiple users through *[time-sharing]*.
