= Microservices (aka. the microservices architecture)

Microservices are a specific implementation of the
*link:./service-oriented-architecture.adoc[service-oriented architecture (SOA)]* pattern. The terms
microservices are SOA are often used interchangeably, but correctly microservices are a subset of
SOA designs in which each service is very small and scoped only to a single business function.

Other defining characteristics of microservices is that each service is very *[loosely coupled]*
from other services. Each service has its own data stores which are not shared with other services
(though data may be *[replicated]* between services). Services communicate with each other through
simple, lightweight protocols such as HTTP, or else indirectly via messaging queues. Individual
services are independently deployable, and may even be developed on differing technology stacks.

The term *nanoservices* has also been used to describe services that are even smaller than
microservices.

If the scope of each microservice were to be the delivery of a discrete user-facing feature, then
the architecture could be described as a cross between a service-oriented architecture and a
*link:./vertical-slice-architecture.adoc[vertical-slice architecture]*.
