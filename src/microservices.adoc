= Microservices (aka. the microservices architecture)

Microservices are a specific implementation of the
*link:./service-oriented-architecture.adoc[service-oriented architecture (SOA)]* pattern. The terms
microservices are SOA are often used interchangeably, but correctly microservices are a subset of
SOA designs in which each service is very small, scoped only to a single business function,
and independently deployable.

There is no definitive list of features that distinguish microservices from more generic
service-oriented architecture, but the following characteristics are widely acknowledged:

.Microservices vs. SOA
|===
|Characteristic |Microservices |SOA

|*Granularity*
|Fine-grained services, often with a single responsibility.
|Mix of fine-grained and coarse-grained services; services may have multiple responsibilities.

|*Communication*
|Typically use lightweight protocols like HTTP, or asynchronous communication.
|May use more complex communication protocols like SOAP.

|*Independence*
|Services are independently deployable and scalable.
|Services may be more interdependent and not always independently deployable.

|*Technology*
|Encourages use of different languages and technology stacks, to optimize individual services based on their use case.
|May use a more uniform technology stack across services.

|*Data*
|Each service manages its own databases and has its own caching layers.
|Services may share common data stores and caches.

|*DevOps*
|Emphasizes continuous deployment and DevOps practices.
|May follow more traditional deployment practices.
|===

The term "microservices" originated in the early 2010s and was popularized by thought leaders such
as Martin Fowler and James Lewis.

The term *[nanoservices]* has also been used to describe services that are even smaller than
microservices.
