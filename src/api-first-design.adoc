= API-first design

API-first design is an approach to *link:./system-design.adoc[system design]* in which the APIs between components of the system, and between the system and the outside world, are designed before the internal code and data structures of the system itself.

For example, in a system with separate front-end and back-end components, each developed by different teams, the teams would collaborate on the client-server API contracts between their two parts of the system before they design the implementation of new features.

In *link:./event-driven-architecture.adoc[Event-driven architecture]*, the event schema are the API contract.
