= Managed hosting

A managed hosting service refers to a type of [web hosting service] in which the service provider
takes care of all these technical aspects of running the infrastructure, including the system
administration and maintenance, monitoring, security, backup and recovery, and scalability and
other customizations.

Managed hosting services are offered by both [cloud service providers] and traditional hosting
providers. They are ideal for businesses that want to leverage advanced technology without the
complexity of managing it themselves, allowing them to focus on their core business activities.
