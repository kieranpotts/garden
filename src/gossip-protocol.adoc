= Gossip Protocol

Gossip Protocol is a decentralized communication protocol used in *[distributed software]* to spread information across all nodes.

It is inspired by the way humans shares news by *word-of-mouth*, where each person who learns the information shares it with others, leading to widespread dissemination.

== How it works

1.  *Initialization*: A node in the system starts with a piece of information, known as a *gossip*/

2.  *Gossip Exchange*: At regular intervals, each node randomly selects another node and shares its current gossip. The receiving node hen merges the received gossip with its own.

3.  *Propagation*: The process repeats, with each node spreading the gossip to others.

4.  *Convergence*: Eventually, every node in the network will have received the gossip, ensuring that all nodes have consistent information.
