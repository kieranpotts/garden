= Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a *[design pattern]* that is supported by *link:./object-oriented-programming.adoc[object-oriented programming]* languages. Encapsulation bundles data and methods that act on that data into a single unit of code â€“ called a class.

The purpose of encapsulation is to protect data from outside interference and misuse.
