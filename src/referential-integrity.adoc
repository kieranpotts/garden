= Referential integrity

Referential integrity is a concept in *[relational databases]* that ensures the relationships between tables are maintained. It enforces the consistency and validity of the relationships between tables by defining rules that must be followed when inserting, updating, or deleting records.

*Eventual referential integrity* refers to a state in which the relationships between tables are *[eventually consistent]*, even if they are not immediately consistent at all times. This concept is often used in *[distributed databases]* and *[distributed systems]* where immediate consistency is not always feasible due to latency, network partitions, or other factors. *Delayed enforcement* of referential integrity constraints may be necessary to ensure that the system remains operational even when immediate consistency is not possible.
