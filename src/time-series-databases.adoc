= Time series databases (TSDB)

A time series database is a software system that stores and manages time-stamped data, where each entry is associated with a specific point in time.

Although it is possible to store time series data in many different database types, the design of these systems is distinct from *link:./relational-databases.adoc[relational databases]*, in which relationships between data points are implemented through referential models, rather than being implicit through timestamps. Therefore, time series databases are a type of *link:./nosql-databases.adoc[NoSQL database]*.
