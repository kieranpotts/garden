= Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a *[design principle]* and *[pattern]* that proposes the separation of command handling (write) logic from query (read) logic. This allows for the independent optimization of both aspects, enhancing performance and scalability.

CQRS works well with *link:./event-sourcing.adoc[event sourcing]*, as queries can be constructed from events, allowing for:

* *Horizontal scalability*: Read and write operations can be scaled independently.

* *Eventual consistency*: Although read views may not immediately reflect changes in state (as is typical in distributed software), they will eventually synchronize.
