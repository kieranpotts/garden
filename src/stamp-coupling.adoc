= Stamp coupling

Stamp coupling is a type of *link:./coupling.adoc[coupling]* in software design where a module is dependent on a data structure or a composite data type, making the module dependent on a specific structure of data rather than just the data itself.

Stamp coupling is considered a weak form of coupling, but it can still lead to issues if not managed properly.
