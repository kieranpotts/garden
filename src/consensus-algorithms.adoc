= Consensus algorithms

In a *[distributed system]*, *[nodes]* need to work together to maintain a *[consistent]* state.
However, due to the inherent challenges of distributed systems – such as network *[latency]*,
node *[failures]*, and *[asynchrony]* – it is difficult to achieve *[consensus]* on the state of
the system.

Consensus algorithms address these challenges by ensuring that all participating nodes agree on
some state or sequence of events, even when some nodes might fail or act maliciously.

== Popular consensus algorithms

* *Paxos*: Paxos works by electing a leader that proposes a value, which is then accepted by a
  majority of the nodes.

* *Raft*: Raft works by designating one node as the loader to manage log replication, and ensure
  consistency across the cluster.
