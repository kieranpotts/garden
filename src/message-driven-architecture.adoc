= Message-driven architecture (MDA)

Message-driven architecture (MDA) is a *[software architecture pattern]* that promotes the production,
consumption, and routing of messages, delivered *link:./asynchronous-communication.adoc[asynchronously]*
via *[message brokers]* (aka. message queues), between software components.

Messages are an abstraction of a piece of data that typically represents one of the following:

* A *command*
* An *event*
* A *query*

Commands and events are very similar. The difference is mostly just in the statement of intent that
underpins their semantics, whether the message is telling another component to do something (a
command), or informing other components that something has happened (an event). And queries are just
one component asking for a piece of data from whatever other component can provide it.

Thus, *link:./event-driven-architecture.adoc[event-driven architecture]* can be seen as a subset
of message-driven architecture, where events are the primary type of message.

== Message distribution patterns

The following patterns are found in message-driven distributed systems:

* *Fan out*: A message is sent to multiple consumers. This allows for parallel processing of
  messages by different components or services. For example, a user action like placing an order
  could trigger updates to inventory, billing, and shipping services. These updates may be handled
  by separate services, and the order of processing may not be important and therefore the
  processing can be done in parallel.

* *Fan in*: Multiple sources send messages to a single consumer. This is used to aggregate data from
  various producers into a single point for processing. For example, collecting logs from multiple
  applications or servers into a central logging service.

* *Broadcasting*: A message is sent to all consumers, regardless of whether they subscribed to it or
  not. This is often used for system-wide notifications, for example sending out alerts or system
  status updates to all connected clients.

* *Multicasting*: Similar to broadcasting, but the message is sent only to a specific group of
  consumers who have subscribed to a particular topic or channel. This is useful for sending updates
  to a specific department or group of users.

* *Point-to-point*: A single message is sent from one producer to one consumer. This ensures that
  each message is processed by one and only one receiver. For example, processing tasks in a job
  queue, where each task needs to be handled by one worker.

* *link:./publish-subscribe-pattern.adoc[Publish-subscribe (pubsub)]*: Producers (publishers) send
  messages to a channel, and consumers (subscribers) receive messages from that channel. Subscribers
  express interest in specific topics and receive only messages related to those topics. This
  pattern is commonly used for real-time data feeds, where users subscribe to topics of interest
  such as stock prices or news updates. This patterns is also the basis for
  *link:./event-driven-architecture.adoc[event-driven]* communication.

* *Scatter-gather*: This pattern involves sending a request to multiple services (scatter),
  collecting their responses (gather), and then aggregating the results. This is useful for
  distributed search queries where results from multiple databases are combined into a single
  response.

* *Request-reply*: A message exchange pattern where a request is sent to a service, and a reply is
  expected in return. It ensures a two-way communication between the client and the server. This
  pattern is commonly used in microservices architectures, where one service needs a response from
  another service.
