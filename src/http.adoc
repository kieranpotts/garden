HTTP is specified by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁: Protocols that power web communication and data transfer.
𝗛𝗼𝘄:
- Implements RESTful methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- Status codes (e.g., 200, 404) indicate request outcomes.
- HTTPS adds encryption via SSL/TLS for secure data transfer.

== HTTP methods

HTTP methods define actions to be performed on the resource identified by the request URI. The most common methods are:

* *GET*: Used to retrieve information from the server. It should not modify the state of the resource, making it ideal for read operations without side effects. Example: fetching a list of users, or details about a specific user.

* *POST*: Used to create a new resource. It is useful when the result of a request creates a state change or side effects on the server. Example: creating a new user.

* *PUT*: Used to update or replace an existing resource. It's important to send the complete entity in the request. Example: updating an existing user's name and age.

* *PATCH*: Unlike PUT, PATCH is used to make partial updates on a resource. Example: updating the name of a user without touching other fields like age.

* *DELETE*: Used to delete a resource. Example: deleting a user.

== HTTP response codes

Common status codes returned by the server in response to a client request include:

* *1xx*: Informational response codes.

  ** *100 Continue**: Indicates that the initial part of the request has been received and the client should continue sending the rest of the request.

* *2xx*: Success response codes.

  ** *200 OK*: The request has been successful. This is the most commonly used code to indicate success.

  ** *201 Created*: The request has been fulfilled and as a result a new resource has been created.

  ** *204 No Content*: The request has been successfully completed, but there is no content to send in the response.

* *3xx*: Redirection response codes.

  ** *301 Moved Permanently*: The resource of the requested URL has been changed permanently. The new URL should be specified in the response.

  ** *302 Found*: Indicates that the request resources is temporarily under a different URL.

* *4xx*: Client error response codes.

  ** *400 Bad Request*: The request cannot be understood or processed by the server due to a client syntax error.

  ** *401 Unauthorized*: Indicates that the request requires authentication and the client has not authenticated itself.

  ** *403 Forbidden*: The server understood the request but is refusing to authorize it.

  ** *404 Not Found*: The server could not find the requested resource.

  ** *405 Method Not Allowed*: The HTTP method used in the request is not allowed for the specified resource.

* *5xx*: Server error response codes.

  ** *500 Internal Server Error*: The server encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.

  ** *502 Bad Gateway*: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.

  ** *503 Service Unavailable*: The server is not ready to handle the request, typically due to maintenance or overload.
