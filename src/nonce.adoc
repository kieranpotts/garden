= Nonce

A *nonce* is a security token that is used to ensure that a message or communication is unique, preventing *link:./replay-attack.adoc[replay attacks]*.

By requiring clients to provide a nonce, the server can verify that the message being sent is fresh and not a replay of an old message.

A nonce is typically implemented as a randomly-generated string or number, which is generated by the client and is unique to each request the client makes to the server.
