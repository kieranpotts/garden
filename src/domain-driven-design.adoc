= Domain-driven design (DDD)
:toc: macro

toc::[]

Domain-driven design was popularized by Eric Evans in his 2003 book of the same name, and which is
colloquially referred to as "the blue book". The concepts behind DDD predate the book, but Evans
brought them together into a coherent architectural pattern and design process.

The central idea behind DDD is to design software to represent things in the real world, rather
than as a series of functions or procedures. Domain-driven software designs are built around models
of their *[business domains]* (the subject areas of the software). The
*link:./ubiquitous-language.adoc[language]* used in the domain models are the same as those
used in the real world.

Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a

The key principle of DDD is to base complex designs on a model of the business domain, and this is
achieved by close collaboration between the technical experts and the domain or subject matter
experts to iteratively refine the conceptual model of the solution.

DDD is particularly beneficial in complex problem spaces, or where the business domain is not well
understood. The domain-driven design process helps to clarify the business domain, to identify the
key concepts and relationships within it, and build a shared understanding of the domain between the
technical and business experts.

DDD can be described as both an *architectural style*, built around a series of recurring
design patterns, and a *design process*. DDD describes a two-stage process for designing software:

* *Strategic design*: You work out what the subdomains are in the business, and the relationships
  between the subdomains.

* *Tactical design*: You refine the domain model, working out what domain objects you will need
  inside each subdomain, and how the subdomain objects interact with each other.

== Strategic design

Although it's possible to apply DDD concepts to an existing application, it is much easier when an
application is built from the ground-up with DDD principles in mind. That's because DDD cuts across
the whole design of an application, forming its broad architectural structure. This is called the
strategic design.

The goal of the strategic design is to end up with a high-level model of the business domain. This
is done by breaking down the business domain into a series of discrete subdomains.

The strategic design is typically developed during a project's *[discovery phase]*. Domains,
subdomains, and key parts are discovered through *[conversations]* with *[domain experts]*. This is
pure business exploration. Methodologies used to discover the domain may include *Big Picture*,
*Process-Level Event Sourcing*, and *Domain Storytelling*. The objective of DDD is that, if the
domain experts had the technical expertise to design the system themselves, the resulting system
would look similar to what the technical people produce under the DDD process.

=== Step 1: Define the domain

The first step in DDD is to define the application *domain*. The domain is the subject area of
the software. It is a sphere of knowledge from the real world, processes within which the software
is intended to automate. In the DDD process, domain experts (people who understand the business)
work with developers to define the application domain. This is as much about defining what the
software will _not_ do as what it will do.

Examples of application domains include customer relationship management, financial loan application
management, video subscription services, and so on.

=== Step 2: Define the subdomains

Once the scope and boundaries of the application are defined in its domain, the second step is to
discover the *subdomains*. A subdomain is a smaller, more specialized area within a domain. Each
subdomain has a specific purpose or represents a particular business capability. For example, in a
video subscription service, the billing, video streaming, and user management areas might be
subdomains.

****
A subdomain is something that exists in the real world and shows how the
business operates in a given area.
****

Subdomains may overlap, and they may even be nested. Some processes in a subdomain may be part of
larger processes in another subdomain, which itself touches several other subdomains.

Some subdomains may be *core domains*. In a video subscription service, the core subdomain would
probably be video streaming. DDD emphasizes that the core domain(s) should be the focus of the
design, and the main focus of the project, while *secondary subdomains* should be as simple as
possible and exist only to support the primary ones.

=== Step 3: Define the key parts

The third step in the strategic design is to work out what are the *key parts* within each subdomain.
For example, if we look at the billing subdomain in our theoretical video subscription service, we
might identify accounts, payment details, and subscription plans as the key parts of that subdomain.

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
left to right direction
rectangle "video subscriptions" {
  rectangle "billing" {
    rectangle "accounts" {
    }
    rectangle "payment details" {
    }
    rectangle "subscription plans" {
    }
  }
  rectangle "video streaming" {
    rectangle "videos" {
    }
    rectangle "viewers" {
    }
  }
  rectangle "user management" {
    rectangle "subscribers" {
    }
  }
}
@enduml
....

Some key parts will be common across multiple subdomains. For example, subscribers will probably be
a key part in most subdomains. But a sign of good strategic design is when each subdomain has a
few key parts that are unique to it, and are not shared by other subdomains. For example, the
billing subdomain might have a "payment details" part, which you would not expect to see in any
of the other subdomains.

=== Step 4: Define the ubiquitous language and bounded contexts

Key parts that are shared between subdomains may not have the same name in each subdomain. For
example, in the billing subdomain, subscribers might be referred to as "accounts", while the
video streaming subdomain might refer to them as "viewers", and the user management subdomain
might use the term "subscribers". Thus, the terms "account", "viewer", and "subscriber" all refer
to the same thing, only the language used to describe them changes depending on the context.
This is a reflection of the real world, where different parts of a business may use different
terminology to describe essentially the same things.

Clearly, there are significant benefits to having a single unified model covering the whole business
domain. However, especially in complex problem spaces, this is often unrealistic. DDD recognizes
that different subdomains may need to have different models, each with its own distinct terminology.

DDD encourages developers and domain experts to collaborate together and develop a common
*ubiquitous language* to describe the whole business domain, so the same business terms are used
consistently by all the stakeholders. The ubiquitous language, taken from the real world business
domain, will be used to specify requirements, to name things in the application code and tests, and
in all forms of communication (both written and verbal) between the business and technical people.

Where terminology varies, the stakeholders should agree *bounded contexts* within which terminology
is consistent. A bounded context will typically span a single subdomain, but it may span several.
Thus, in most cases, there will be a 1:1 mapping between subdomains and bounded contexts, and
therefore the terms are synonymous. However, in some cases, it may make sense to combine multiple
subdomains into a single bounded context. For example, when two or more subdomains use identical
terminology and have significant interdependencies. Within each bounded context, the stakeholders
should settle on a ubiquitous language for it, in which there is a single term for each concept.

.Subdomains versus bounded contexts
****
* *Subdomains* help us to understand complex business domains by dividing them into smaller parts.
  They represent real-world business capabilities wrapped into cohesive groups.

* *Bounded contexts* represent independent, unified models, which allow us to transfer knowledge
  from subdomains into our technical solutions.
****

What makes a system complex is not so much the number of subdomains, but rather the number of
bounded contexts. Ideally, a complete system will have a single bounded context, with common
vocabulary and domain objects used everywhere.

But where terminology differs between subdomains (where there are multiple bounded contexts), the
terminology should be translated between the bounded contexts. In code, this is done using
*anti-corruption layers* at the interfaces between subdomains. Each module's user interface is
responsible for ensuring that languages and terms from another context do not pollute the module's
own context.

Bounded contexts help to manage *[complexity]*, and are particularly beneficial for managing
accidental complexity that arises through *[evolutionary design]*. For example, imagine that an
insurance business acquires a competitor, and begins the process of integrating their disparate
IT systems. Although the domain is the same (insurance), the two companies will likely have
modeled their domain entirely differently. They will each have developed different business rules,
terminology, and actors. Therefore, rather than try to integrate the two systems into the same
subdomains, it may make sense to keep them separate – at least initially. So you would have a
"Home Insurance" context and a "Health Insurance" context.

Tools such as a https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas[Bounded Context Canvas] may
be used to help define the bounded contexts and the ubiquitous language of each.

=== Step 5: Define context maps

The final part of the strategic design is to learn how the various subdomains interact with each
other. This is about defining the relationships between different parts of the business.

In DDD, this is done by creating a *context map*. This is a visual representation of communication
paths (and directions) between the subdomains.

For example, the video streaming subdomain needs to know what quality of video to stream to the
user, and since this is dependent upon the subscription plans encapsulated in the billing subdomain,
the video streaming subdomain will need to communicate with the billing subdomain. Therefore,
there will need to be a mapping between a viewer in the streaming domain and the subscriber in the
billing domain.

Tools such as the https://contextmapper.org/[Context Mapping DSL (CML)] may be used to model
bounded contexts and to map the relationships between them.

== Tactical design

The strategic design phase of DDD is about mapping out the subdomains within the business domain,
and the relationships between them. With this complete, the design process moves on to defining the
domain objects within each subdomain. This is known as the tactical design.

Whereas the strategic design is very much a _discovery_ process, the tactical design is more of a
technical _design_ process. Another way of thinking about it is that the strategic design
produces a *conceptual architecture* for the solution, while the tactical design fleshes this into
a more detailed *logical architecture*.

DDD provides a set of tactical patterns that can be used to define the domain objects within each
subdomain. The two main tactical patterns are *entities* and *value objects*. Other tactical
patterns are *aggregates*, *repositories*, and *services*.

Like the ubiquitous language, tactical patterns are scoped to particular bounded contexts. Thus, if
a bounded context is composed or more than one subdomain, the subdomains within that context will
all share the same set of entities, values, and other domain objects. Many of these constructs will
map to the key parts identified in the strategic design.

=== Entities

Entities are representations of things in the real world, such as subscribers.

Each entity has a unique identifier. Even if two objects have identical properties, they are
considered different entities if they have different IDs.

Entities are mutable. We can change their properties over time (except for their ID). For example,
a subscriber may change their email address, but it's still the same subscriber because its ID
does not change.

=== Value objects

Value objects are objects that represent a value in a subdomain, such as a date or a price.

Unlike entities, value objects are not unique. Two objects with the same value are considered to be
equal.

The values of value objects may be considered to be always "correct", since validation is done at
construction of the objects.

Value objects are also immutable. If you need to change a value object, you create a new one.

Entities may be composed of one or more value objects. For example, a subscriber may have a name,
email address, and date of birth – all of which could be implemented as value objects. You could use
normal values, but by creating value objects you are explicitly stating that this value is an
important part of the subdomain. By comparison, implementation details such as the "last modified
date" of an entity may not be considered important enough to be a value object. If the values are
not relevant to the business but are required only to implement the software, we may call these
*technical values*.

Whether a piece of data should be modeled as an entity or a value object is not always a clear-cut
decision. For example, an address could be modeled as either (value objects do not have to be
restricted to a single value). In general, if something is important to the business it should be
modeled as an entity. For example, in a real estate application, addresses may be important enough
to be modeled as entities. However, if the address is just a way to contact a customer, it may be
more appropriate to model it as a value object.

You should end up with lots more value objects than entities in your domain model.

=== Aggregates

Aggregates are groups of several entities and value objects. An example could be an order, which
would be composed of a customer entity, the products ordered (also entities), and value objects
such as the order total and the shipping address.

An aggregate also forms a *transactional boundary*, which means that whenever changes are made to
an aggregate they should either be committed to or rolled back from a database or other persistence
mechanism. This ensures that aggregates are always in a consistent state.

Like entities, aggregates have unique IDs.

Aggregates are also responsible for maintaining *business invariance*. These are business rules
that always remain true, no matter what you do to your system. For example, you might have a rule
that an order's total must always be the sum of all the products ordered. You might have another
rule that stops customers from buying more than what is in stock. This comes at a cost; the more
rules that are encoded in aggregates, the more complex they become and they may get slower to
update. So there is sometimes a a trade-off to be made between performance and consistency.
Sometimes it might make sense to setup a *corrective policy*, which runs on a regular basis to
either flag or automatically correct anything that might be wrong.

=== Repositories

Repositories are abstractions of the persistence layers of our system (usually databases).

=== Services

Services contain business logic that does not neatly fit into a single aggregate, or which spans
multiple aggregates.
