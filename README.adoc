= Garden

This is my digital garden â€“ a collection of bookmarks, notes, thoughts, and
ideas, a sort of personal knowledgebase.

My digital garden is a perpetual work-in-progress, a series living documents
that I update and refine incrementally. I use Asciidoc to format my notes. I
write atomic notes, which means that each `.adoc` file focused on a single idea
or concept. Topics may cross-reference one another, but each note is
self-contained.

Like any garden, a digital one requires planning and regular maintenance. I
am selective about which topics get added to my garden, and where I place them,
and I regularly weed out notes that are no longer relevant or useful to me.

the concept of the digital garden.
